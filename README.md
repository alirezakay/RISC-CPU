# RISC-CPU
> A multi-cycle RISC CPU (processor) like MIPS-CPU architecture in VHDL ( a hardware-side implementation )

## Documentation
This project is implemented in `VHDL` language with `ISE` simulator software with **a particular specifications**.

Relevant course for this project could be `computer architecture`.

These codes here in github, are just the vhdl and wave files.

If you wanna get the ***complete project codes, built with `ISE`*** go [here](https://alirezakay.github.io/showcase/y2/risc-cpu-simulation), find the project title and **download** the full one.

here is an approximately complete documentaion in **Persian** and also **English** language: [document](./MyCPU.pdf)
